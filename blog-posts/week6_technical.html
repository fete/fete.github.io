              <h3>Ruby Class Methods</h3>

              <p>By: Clifton ---> Published: 10/05/14<br> After perusing the web for a solid definition and explanation on Class Methods  I came across class methods while reading the highly regarded text “The Well Grounded Rubyist” by David A. Black . I must say I’m getting fond of this text in making my Ruby notes and would like to share some of it’s take on Class Methods. Class methods are single methods which are defined on a class object. The idea of a class method is that you send a message to the object that’s the class rather than to one of the class’s instances. Let’s say I create a class called Tickets and wanted to create a class method of that class I’ll simply write:<br>

              class Ticket
                 def Ticket.most_expensive(*tickets)
                    tickets.max_by(&:price)
                 end
              end<br>
              “Ticket.most_expensive” represents the defined class method that we can access through the class object Ticket  but not through its instances. Individual instances of the class Ticket don’t have this method. We can also use the notation “self.most_expensive” for the class method, with self replacing the class’ name.<br>

              Class methods enable the execution of certain operations pertaining to a class that can’t be performed by individual instances of that class. The “.new” method is an excellent example. “Ticket.new” is called because, until we’ve created an individual ticket (instance of Ticket class), we can’t send it any messages! The class therefore needs to make the instances therefore we define a method with the class Ticket. A class object (like Ticket ) has its own methods, its own state, and its own identity. It doesn’t share these things with instances of itself.</p>
