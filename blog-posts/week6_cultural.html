              <h3>Cultural Stereotype Threat</h3>
              <img src="http://www.triradar.com/files/2010/12/HumanRaceLogo.jpg"/>
              <p>By: Clifton ---> Published: 10/05/14<br>Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group. Who knew there was science for this stuff? I must say it made for interesting reading though. I have been on the end of a plethora of stereotypes. Considering I’m from a foreign country this was something I expected but I didn’t really expect the vast creativity of ignorant people when it came to looking at an individual and making up stereotypes. I’ve heard it all from nerd to jock to partier to failure and even terrorist. I guess the fact that it’s such an unusually wide spectrum of stereotypes I tend to just laugh it all off and just put it down to people just not being sensible. Maybe if there were just a few particular stereotypes I was labelled with I would be more self conscious about it and maybe even adapt to such standards but thankfully the haters or confused individuals (as I tend to call them) have not won any battles with me.<br>
              I am someone who was made aware before entering a new culture how I’ll be perceived and why so. Thus I kind of had a head start on the whole thing and was understanding of peoples expectations. In college I wasn’t expected to be an athlete because I looked Indian to some folk and from what I gather from the critics, indians aren’t athletic. I wasn’t expected to be on the Student Government  board because I had an accent and some people thought that would hinder my ability to communicate. I won all my elections and became the first student to win 3 years running. When people realized I was from the Caribbean I was just expected to just be a party animal that drinks alcohol…well I am not a drinker but I do love a great party lol So I’ll give them that win lol.<br>
              Outside of school I’ve had my fair share of moments encountering stereotypes also. On the subway people tend to not sit next to me and I’ve been called terrorist numerous times while minding my own business walking casually. This is not just something common everyday people will classify me as because my visits to the airport are always and adventure. I usually ignore people and just go about my day because it’s more funny that hurtful to me. I am not one to be angered by such folly as stereotypes. I will advise anyone to not be vexed by it but understand more as to why it exists within the person and try help them understand you cause I believe with understanding there’s knowledge and thus perspective can be gained. Bearing in mind though that not everyone is a willing listener just be yourself and know that you are an individual that can make your own path.<br>

              In general I understand that not everyone has the knowledge to know about diversity in the world. I get it that in a world where things are very visual that we judge each other visually too and we make judgments based on visual keys. It’s how the mind works. Just like if you grow up seeing fire burning stuff you know when you see a fire that it’s dangerous. People though are supposed to be advanced enough though to know that individuals can’t be generalized into groups based on some or even the majority’s behavior. We are all individuals and have different life experiences and can choose our behaviors. I know some people follow the crowd and thus stereotypes can exist but as humans we should judge more with our mind and heart than with our eyes. Give people a chance to make there own mark of who they are and don’t make it for them. </p>
