I really enjoy the fact that the environment DBC creates is one where you take the journey with others as opposed to against others. This definitely gives me more comfort and confidence in the arduous journey that the course serves up. DBC is still everything I expected and their transparency and commitment really shines through. My drive is building and my stamina for learning coding is increasing. Just knowing that it is difficult yet rewarding is enough to build my desire to keep the ball rolling.<br>
The prep thus far has really lived up to the hype. I have definitely realized that one needs to be fully engrossed in the process and make it yours. I am curious though about the inclusion of phase 4 and if the NYC location will have any further info on it. I look forward to the program and soaking in everything while sharing also. The games have begun!</p>
