              <p>By: Clifton ---> Published: 09/14/14<br>I am usually not one to read much into generalizations cause I’m a strong believer in individuality and not being classified in a group. So when DBC asked me to take the Gregorc’s Mind Styles model to help me learn about my learning style, I wasn’t too thrilled but I figured if it can help me learn this mountain of material better then I’m game for it.<br>
Based on the test, provided by the Gregorc’s Mind Styles model, I got the Abstract Sequential thinking style. I was a bit surprised, but I figured let me do some research into it. I found that Abstract Sequential thinkers are good at visualizing things, good at looking beyond and are logical thinkers. Now with this knowledge I realized I can actual adapt some of my study habits to enable me to respond better mentally to new and complicated material. Maybe I can watch some videos of concepts and draw things out step by step so I can rationalize them and retain info better. Just writing this my head is nodding because these are techniques that I knew from before that I always  looked to when the tough got going.Maybe now I can take a more structured approach to these learning techniques and be more efficient in my study habits.<br>
Thus far at DBC my most difficult challenge has been fully grasping JavaScipt and now I realized a lot of that is due to the fact that I never found good video and structured material on it while searching my external resources. To compensate for this I can start taking the notes given to me and make them more visual so I can use my preferred retention techniques to work for my benefit.<br>
From my research I can confirm that the thinking styles and learning techniques can surely influence how I retain and understand material and these are things I knew before; but now my plan is to be more structured in what I do, so that my learning techniques are not done haphazardly. Providing structure may take up some time initially but in the long run I will benefit because efficiency will increase and if i have to revise my work things will be in place ready for me to take advantage of it.</p>
