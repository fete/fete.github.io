              <p>By: Clifton ---> Published: 09/14/14<br>Ever since JavaScript’s introduction in 1995, as a way to add programs to web pages on Netscape Navigator browser, the language has climbed into adoption by all major graphical web browsers. It has made the current generation of web applications possible—browser-based email clients, maps, and social networks—and is also used in more traditional sites to provide various forms of interactivity and cleverness.
Javascript is surely having it’s say on why it’s so popular in web development and here are some more points:<br>
Easy to learn:<br>
JavaScript is easy to pick up because of the very flexible nature of the language, is widely standardized across common browsers and is far more useful than ever before!  Because JavaScript is not a compiled language, things like memory management are not a big concern. You won’t find yourself having to worry about loading and unloading content, compiling, or setting primitive data types because most of the heavy lifting is handled by the browser.<br>
Easy to edit:<br>
 JavaScript is a scripting programming language so the code you write does not need to be compiled and as such does not require a compiler or any other expensive software to write. That’s right, JavaScript is just plain text, so all you need to write it is notepad or any other plain text editor.
It’s a Prototyping Language:
objects can be defined and developed on the fly to suit a particular use, rather than having to build out specific classes to handle a specific need. This opens the door for very rapid and flexible development as well as a wide array of possible design patterns that would not be possible in more structured languages.<br>

Node.js:<br>
Node.js is built on Google Chrome’s JavaScript Runtime engine called V8. What this means is that while a normal server side language has to process everything sequentially, JavaScript does not have that limitation. It can start task A, move on to task B, processing both (or as many instances as needed) at once. This makes the ability of a server to serve up web pages unimaginably more powerful and makes things like DOS (Denial of Service) attacks a thing of the past (in theory).<br>
Now that we have explored some of the many upsides of JavaScript let’s look at some of the limitations one may encounter. Péter Halácsy (co-founder and CTO of Prez) hit the nail on the head with his article on JavaScript. He stated that JavaScript is caught in an iron triangle of its own making. We’ve all grown accustomed to the flexibility and freedom it offers, and we don’t want to give that up. At the same time, we want it to be blazing fast, and it turns out that when you reach millions of lines of JavaScript, maintaining such a flexible language becomes a problem. All three of these areas — flexibility, performance, and maintainability — are intertwined. When you make progress in one area, one of the other two, or even both, will suffer. This tells me that there is no one silver bullet that will solve these problems, but there may be many that do. 
JavaScript isn’t going away anytime soon and there’s much being done (MLOC.js conference) to ensure the language not only improves on it’s faults but survives for the long haul.
