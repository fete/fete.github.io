              <p>By: Clifton ---> Published: 09/22/14<br>I must say this was the most depressing assignment to date.  I thought I’ll try to find a unique problem facing the tech industry and expand on it and try not to be cliche about what I write etc. Well sorry folks no originality here.  It seems for all the big data and implementation articles I found they were increasingly outnumbered by the social injustices that are infecting the industry. Which ones you say? Well I must say almost no stone has been left unturned,  from kids to women to even the environment.  Yes I know the usual suspects of the who’s who when it comes to how we can better our society. But that’s just my point. For all the problem it seems that we as humans are accomplishing in tech it seems like the light is not shining bright enough in certain sectors.<br>
              Now I don’t believe the tech industry is at fault, because some of these problems are pervasive throughout society and has just meshed into the tech landscape. Lets for the interest of brevity look at the strife faced by women in the tech world. Now I’m not going to give you the hundreds of statistics and personal stories I’ve read, but I’m just going to speak from my immediate concern after digesting all the aforementioned material.  This sucks!! For an industry I laud for being great on the quality of life and treatment of their employees, why are women treated as outcasts. Whether it’s looking for VC funding, expressing opinions or receiving suggestive comments it seems that the industry is failing women badly.  I’m big on visual aids to get people’s attention so I rather refer you to the following graphical representations to digest some of the other disappointing trends I discovered when it comes to women representation in the tech industry.</p> <br>
              <img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/04/04/techsexism-graphic/a132e629c297fd7fa975ba6e47ae3fe1d5782473/0406-web-TECHSEXISM-300.png"/>
              <p>I personally believe in a diverse working environment and will always believe that qualified women should reap the fruits of their labor like any other person. In general I believe the unfair treatment can be attributed to many things but in particular the mental approach people have towards women is something we can adjust. A lot of these things are ingrained in a society and it’s people from since birth. Now not everyone will shape their opinions and actions the same way but I believe the majority of people have succumbed to what’s commercialized as what a woman is and stands for. <br>
              Forward thinking is what can help this situation and no we can’t stop how society depicts sexes (then world peace may be possible), but I believe the more everyone gets involved in learning about not only the plight of women in the industry but what they are doing to progress we can all gain better appreciation and realization for the cause. Sharing in ones struggle and progression gives you a better perspective and these are the kinds of things that can change minds. A changed mind can change one’s actions and habits; thus allowing people to influence others to change. Yea I know that sounds like a slow process but it’s the route I chose to understand more and the route I choose to help others walk. So let’s be human again and solve this tech problem starting with you, cause you know it’s right.
