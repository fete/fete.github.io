              <p>By: Clifton ---> Published: 09/28/14<br>Pairing has been a breath of fresh air. I am a pretty social person but the fact that one has to actually work on a challenge made me feel a bit apprehensive at first. I guess I just didn’t want to pair on a challenge and be stuck on a problem or not be able to contribute enough to the challenge. So at first I tried to get my prep in be well versed in the material  then pair on a challenge. I was then thoroughly able to assist and contribute to the challenge. I felt good and was motivated to keep up the process. There was an instance though where I paired on a challenge I didn’t fully prepare for. I was nervous and even thought about canceling the appointment. I went into the session less energetic anticipating that I will be seen as incompetent by my pair and I felt that I was cheating the individual by being unprepared. It just so happened I was able to contribute and learned so much form my pair. This gave me new insight on the pairing process. It’s not about showing what you know or being the master of your craft.<br> There will be times in one’s career where you will go into a pairing session and you won’t have a full grasp of the material. It’s important to make sure and go in with a free spirit knowing that even if you don’t know everything to help at that point in time, you and your pair can work together to attain that common goal and thus you both learn more and gain a level of trust and camaraderie. To me that’s been the main take form these sessions. Meeting great people, working on challenges together with the knowledge you have and learning together.<br>
              I was so excited to read my feedback just to see how my views were received. I got good reviews on the specific and kind aspects of my reviews but I was deemed to not be fully forthcoming with the actionable feedback. I smiled because I knew to myself it was true, and although I knew while I was writing my feedback that I should include the actionable aspects, I held back out of concern that I maybe too critical. After thinking about it though I realized I was just not only cheating myself out of honesty I was also cheating that person I paired and connected with. In this environment it’s all about making each other better and I can’t be selfish and short change my pair. From then on I made it my duty to point out all and any actionable traits my respective pairs should improve on or continue with. I have even seen a change in how my feedback is reviewed and it makes me feel fulfilled to know I held up my end of the bargain of making each other better.<br>
              Yes I have officially drank the juice! Pairing and feedback works and helps those involved and after all isn’t that what working together should be all about; and who better than your fellow aspiring developers to help and grow with you. </p>
