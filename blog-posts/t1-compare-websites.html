         <p><img src="<!--Image here-->"/><br>Twitter.com:
   Twitter provides a custom feed based on who you follow thus the tweets you see are all relative to you. Okay maybe the odd Hollywood tweet slips in (@HuffingtonPost) but for the most part the content keeps my attention and I check for updates regularly; and in times like this, where all one wants is relative info at a fast pace it’s the perfect cup of tea for me all day.
   The center of the page has the constantly updating news feed and this holds your attention for it’s the essence of the site; tweets and more tweets. Visually the site has a very defined, minimalist, contrasting, vibrant and structured design.
No longer does one have to sift through news or other media to find information that is relative to their tastes; Twitter provides easy and aesthetically pleasing access to this. Whether you want the latest hollywood gossip or the latest news in research, it’s all there, provided in a practical, engaging, fun, enlightening and informative way.
   Twitter combines visual pleasure with directed content. The navigation is simple and well defined. With the images and buttons being very easy to discern and comprehend one can navigate the site comfortably and even get lost in the content it offers, because it draws you in to want more. I’ve never made a purchase via Twitter and I’m not interested in that aspect. I know of some platforms that are trying to monetize in this way with Twitter but I have yet to be converted into a twitter shopper, because my interests are in reading their content.




6pm.com:
   6pm.com is a wallets nightmare! Man this site has great sales everyday and it’s suited to me tastes and fashion. As soon as you land on the site there’s a slide show of all the big sales on the respective brands. That definitely catches my attention from near and far, because that’s what I go there for. Deals!
   The site is organized, clean cut, attractive, simplistic and has a welcoming palate. One is able to get brand named, quality products at a reduced price. Whether it be clothing, shoes or accessories it’s all there. Not all the sales are relative to me as both male and female products are displayed for sale, but you can count on relative, quality, practical, informative and satisfactory content.
   Navigation is a breeze as there’s always filters for you to fine specific items. Due to the volume of items on the page it may take a while to scour the entire site but the nav. menu  is always there to get you back to the home page. One can easily get side tracked on 6pm.com because the deals and recommendations are crazy good and most times are right up your alley. Oh how time flies when you having fun! I’ve surely purchased many items from this site and they have always been up to  par thus why I look forward to shopping there more.




Goal.com:
   Goal.com for me is all about the content. Good up to date soccer news and transfer speculations. The site draws you in with the big rotating banner of top stories, which are the day’s big headlines. The content design tends to be clustered,  dated, cluttered, traditional and dreary. Yes you get up to the min news on the soccer world but the content is sort of unappealing to go through visually.
That in  mind though the info is mostly relative, informative, engaging, entertaining and unique. So yea the design is a bit off but the validity of the content makes up for it.
   The nav. controls are straight forward and their menu is always available to go back to the respective pages. Once you get started reading the content you get hooked especially the transfer rumors. The site mostly has affiliated links to purchase various things but I a not a fan of that and tend to not spend my money on this content based site.</p>
