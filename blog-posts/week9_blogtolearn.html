              <p>By: Clifton ---> Published: 10/26/14<br>I wanted to improve my site that is documenting my journey to code so I decided to send the site’s link out to a few reliable friends for some feedback. I must say I was a bit apprehensive at first because I already had some improvements in mind but I thought it’s always better to have some more eyes viewing your work to get different perspectives.<br>
              Upon getting the feedback I was really pleased with the detail of how I can improve the site and of the good things I’ve already done. I sifted through the recommendations and decided to implement some that I can in a timely manner. It should be noted there was some suggestions that I will implement but not at this time due to the time required. I’m trying to maintain some time-boxing for efficiency sake.<br>
              From the suggestions I got I decided to make the following changes:<br>
              - improve the images for the social media nav bar<br>
              - Improved the header<br>
              - adjusted the margins of certain elements<br>
              - cleaned up the code for the CSS<br>
              Now I had a much longer list but once I got started I noticed so many more code improvements can be made. For instance, with my nav bar I realized that I needed it to be floated and also width and margin adjustments needed to be made to accommodate the other respective changes. This was a common theme. As I made one adjustment I had to readjust many other elements to make sure the site looked balanced. As I made the header position fixed I needed to adjust the positioning of the other elements such as the nav bar and social media bar and the div that contains the image and the current info.<br>
              As I made the respective changes though I not only reinforced some concepts I learned but I noticed a difference in the appearance of the site. The process of attaining feedback surely helped and made me even more motivated to fix certain elements because now I can’t wait for my friends to view the site again and share their thoughts once more…and the feedback and pushing code loop will continue. </p>
