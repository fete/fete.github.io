              <ol>
                 <li>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</li>
                 <p>  I don’t get into many conflicts so I had to reach back in my memory for this one. My friends and I were being cursed at by some individuals because they thought we were speaking about them in a negative way. Although I ignored them at first the person kept pressing the issue and began to send racial and ethnic slurs my way. Thus a friend and I decided to confront them to find out what was the problem. The war of words continued and one of the individuals raised their hand to me and a friend  when we approached ... long story short, the individual decided to file a police report because “he was attacked for no reason”.  </p>
                 <li>What was the source of the conflict?</li>
                 <p>The individual felt offended by something they thought they heard. From my perspective I didn’t appreciate the racial and ethnic slurs and the threats of physical harm.</p>
                 <li>How did you handle that conflict?<li>
                 <p>I approached the person with my hands behind my back and spoke to him in a respectable manner but when my friend and I was threatened with bodily harm we defended ourselves.</p>
                 <li>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?<li>
                 <p>Our actions made things worst. Starting from confronting the individual to acting to defend ourselves.</p>
                 <li>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?<li>
                 <p>I won’t do anything different. That situation has changed me a lot in terms of how I deal with people and I have developed a greater sense of control of my emotions and reading of situations.</p>
                 <li>What did you learn from this experience?<li>
                 <p>I learned that some people love to start stuff and when they come out on the bad end of the deal they do what they can to make your life miserable aka call the police and cry wolf. People are are at times selfish and self gain is a priority. You have to always analyze situations and think of the consequences and make the best decision for you and your future, because when it comes down to it don't let an idiot control your path in life. Be in control always.</p>
