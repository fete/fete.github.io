              <p>By: Clifton ---> Published: 10/19/14<br>Yes I am learning Ruby and I love it and all it’s lovely methods that make life easier but what’s this Rails thing I always see and hear about. I know it’s something I should probably know but maybe I don’t know enough to need to know what it is…
              Those have been some of my thoughts but tonight I was determined to at least have a basic grasp of what Rails or Ruby On Rails is. So after surfing the net and reading several articles the one by Mr. Daniel Kehoe really stood out as a simplified account  of what Rails is and it allowed me to formulate the following.<br>
              As we know thanks to Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto we’ve been blessed with the Ruby programming language. So how does Rails or Ruby on Rails fit in this picture. For starters,  it was originally coined  “Ruby on Rails” by it’s credited creator David Heinemeier Hansson, but now it tends to go by Rails depending on the weather or personal preference I guess. Rails is a software library that is added to the Ruby programming language and extends it. Technically, it is a package library (specifically, a RubyGem), that is installed using the operating system command-line interface.
              Rails serves as a framework for building websites. As such, Rails establishes conventions for easier collaboration and maintenance. These conventions are codified as the Rails API (the application programming interface, or directives that control the code). Learning Rails means learning how to use the Rails conventions and its API.<br>
              Rails combines the Ruby programming language with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application that runs on a web server. Because it runs on a web server, Rails is considered a server-side, or “back end,” web application development platform (the web browser is the “front end”). Rails, in a larger sense, is more than a software library and an API. It is the central project of a vast community that produces software libraries that simplify the task of building complex websites. Members of the Rails community share many core values, often use the same tools, and support each other with an informal network that is built on volunteerism. Rails is popular among web startups, significantly because the pool of open source software libraries (RubyGems, or “gems”) makes it possible to build complex sites quickly.<br>

              Ok so we have an idea of what Rails is, but what does it do? Web browsers combines three kinds of files—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—to display web pages. A browser obtains the files from a web server. Web servers deliver HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, either from static files that are stored on the server, or from an “application server” that creates files dynamically using a programming language such as Ruby. A software program written in Ruby and organized using Rails conventions is a “web application.” Rails combines the Ruby programming language with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application. Rails uses Ruby to dynamically assemble HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from component files (often adding content from a database).<br>
              Why create a web application? A web browser needs only a single HTML file to display a web page (CSS and JavaScript files are optional). However, if you are creating several web pages, you might want to assemble the HTML file from smaller components. For example, you might make a small file that will be included on every page to make a footer (Rails calls these “partials”). Consider another example: If you are displaying content from a database, you might not want the complex programming code that accesses the database mixed into your HTML (programmers call this separation of concerns and it makes for more modular, maintainable programs). Finally, if you are using a web application server such as the one supplied with Rails, you can add features to your website that have been developed and tested by other people so you don’t have to build everything yourself. These are all reasons to create a web application.<br>
              Thus Ruby on Rails make the development of web applications easier. So we now have a better idea of what the fuss seems to be about…efficiency and convenience. This is just a basic overview and Rails has much more to it but I hope this post has shed some light where there was curiosity.</p>
