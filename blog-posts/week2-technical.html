         <p>While stylizing your beatutiful HTML code with CSS you will realize there comes a time when you need to shift things around for the sake of positioning and aesthetics. Now although CSS provides us with many positional elements to play with, today I'll give you a fundamental break down of some of the more commonly used properties "margin", "border" and "padding".<br>When we create content on sites they are thought to be in a box. The content (a heading, paragraph, etc) is surrounded by a border (thus creating a box) and we can manipulate this box in relation to other content using the above terms in our CSS code.</p><br>
         <img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/D9nU6.gif"/><br><p>Refer to the image above and imagine the word content refers to the words of a headline you input into your site. The margin refers to the space outside of the box (that has your content) and how far your box is in relation to other elements on the site. The larger the margin the further the box is from other elements and the smaller the margin the closer it gets.</p>
         <ol><p>Syntax:</p>
            <li> "margin:auto:" to automatically put equal left and right spaces on the sides of the box.</li>
            <li>"margin-top:","margin-right:", "margin-bottom:" or "margin-left:" to specify the direction you want the box to move by adding a value after the colon. </li>
            <li>"margin:1px 2px 3px 4px" to set all sides a value at once (starting at the top and going clockwise).</li>
         </ol>

            <p>The border is the edge of the box. Yes I know it's like any border, no tricks here. This CSS property allows you to specify the style, size and color of the border that has your content.</p>
            <ol><p>Syntax:</p>
                <li>"border-styles:value;" with values like "none", "dotted", "dashed", "solid", etc</li>
                <li>"border-width:value;" with values like "1px", "2px", etc</li>
                <li>"border-color:value;" with values like "red", "#FFFFFF", etc</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Padding refers to the spacing between the content (the heading, paragraph, etc) and the border of the box. Thus allowing you to manipulate how close or far you want your content to your border.</p>
            <ol><p>Syntax:</p>
                <li>"padding-top:","padding-right:", "padding-bottom:" or "padding-left:" to specify the direction you want the content to move (in relation to the border) by adding a value after the colon.</li>
                <li>"padding:1px 2px 3px 4px" to set all sides a value at once (starting at the top and going clockwise).</li>

            </ol>
             <p>Now that was a basic reference to "margin", "border" and "padding", and there are some variations in syntax that one can come by but once you get these down pack then you'll be on your way to showing CSS who's the boss. </p>
