              <p>When you think of the times in your life where you’ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which values come to mind?</p>
              <ul>
                 <li>Accomplishment</li>
                 <li>Activism</li>
                 <li>Affection</li>
                 <li>Close relationships</li>
                 <li>Control</li>
                 <li>Growth</li>
                 <li>Honesty</li>
                 <li>Integrity</li>
                 <li>Loyalty</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Honesty about who I am, what I know and what I stand for are important traits that I hold dear to my  heart. This has molded me to become more at ease with how I live and my views of life.<br>
              Control is an aspect of myself I have worked on and am proud to say it’s a great asset I have. To be able to control my emotions and thought processes has led to many moments of enlightenment and understanding that I value and appreciate as part of my growth.<br> In general, I try to live up to these values: Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</p>

              <ul>
                 <li>Accomplishment 5</li>
                 <li>Activism  5</li>
                 <li>Affection  5</li>
                 <li>Close relationships  5</li>
                 <li>Control  5</li>
                 <li>Growth  5</li>
                 <li>Honesty  5</li>
                 <li>Integrity  5</li>
                 <li>Loyalty  5</li>
              </ul>

              <p>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Does it relate to your values?<br>I recently advised a friend about depression. He has been going through a lot and didn’t know how to approach things. After we spoke for a while we got to realize he needed to be more honest with himself. Be honest about his emotions, his lifestyle and relationships. He wasn’t being realistic about his situation and the things he needed to do to make improvements in his life. Though it’s easier said than done, he confirmed that he needs to make the adjustment and will work towards it.<br> Values can be a powerful way to negate stereotype threat if you can bring them to mind when you are under a threat. For this part, consider:<br>

              How do you feel when you think about your values?<br>
              I feel proud and responsible for the fact that not only I have accomplished a lot but I have a responsibility to maintain my standard and beyond to set a good example for others to learn from and even follow.<br>

              Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?<br>
              Yes once I recognize stereotype threat I exercise control and integrity in my actions to show that such judgements don’t phase or dictate how I move on in life. Reacting positive in light of negativity is something I try to always do because this takes great strength and brings a sense of accomplishment and confidence in yourself.<br>

              Can you think of any mental or physical exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?<br>
              I love to go to the gym to get my mind settled and regain focus. For me it’s a time to become one with myself and my goals and block out all negative energy that can engulf my mind. I leave the gym reenergized and ready for the next step forward. </p>
