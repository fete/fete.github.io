              <h3>SQL Injection</h3>
              <img src="http://www.marcofolio.net/images/stories/useful/features/sql_inject/sql_inject.png"/>
              <p>By: Clifton ---> Published: 10/12/14<br>After learning the basics of SQL I was most fascinated by SQL Injections and decided to expand on it based on the research I did to understand it better. I must credit (mostly) veracode.com and w3school.com for the insight and literature they provided towards my comprehension in this topic.<br>
              SQL Injection is a type of web application security vulnerability in which an attacker is able to submit a database SQL command which is executed by a web application, exposing the back-end database. A web application  that utilizes user-supplied data without proper validation or encoding as part of a command or query are typically vulnerable to attack. The malicious user inputs specially crafted user data that tricks the application into executing unintended commands or changing data. SQL Injection allows an attacker to create, read, update, alter, or delete data stored in the back-end database.  Most commonly SQL Injection attacks gives access to sensitive information such as social security numbers, credit card number or other financial data.<br>
              SQL Injection Preventions:<br>
                  -  Adopt an input validation technique that authenticates against a set of defined rules for length, type, and syntax and also against business rules.<br>
                  - Ensure that users with the permission to access the database have the least privileges, i.e. do not use system administrator accounts like “sa” for Web applications. Also, you should always make sure that a database user is created only for a specific application and this user is not able to access other applications.<br>
                  - Use strongly typed parameterized query APIs with placeholder substitution markers, even when calling stored procedures.<br>
                  - Show care when using stored procedures since they are generally safe from injection. However, be careful as they can be injectable (such as via the use of exec() or concatenating arguments within the stored procedure).</p>
