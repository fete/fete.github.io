      <h3>Compare Driver and Navigator</h3>
      <p>The driver is in charge of syntax and organization of the code based on the guidance of the navigator.</p>
      <p>The navigator is tasked with guiding the driver through each section of code and maintaining the overall flow to the site.</p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
   <p>The GPS session was nerve racking (I didn't know what to expect for the challenge) at first but once I met my partner and the instructor things flowed well. We all checked in and got down to the challenge. We worked well interchanging and designaing the driver and navigator roles whether it be in the design or coding phase. I thoroughly enjoyed it! Some things I didn't like was the fact that some of the software suggested (flockdraw) are things I'm not familiar with so there is a learnig curve and thus time consumption. In the future it will be better to have prior knowledge of the programs being used so that I make my self familiar with them. </p>
