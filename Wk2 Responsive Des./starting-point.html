  <div class="reflection">
<p> The literature I read about responsive design was very informative, though I felt that I was missing something so once again I reverted to finding some tutorial videos to see the concepts in action. The visuals of the processes and steps really allowed me to solidify the steps and concepts I read about and I'm ralizing that "video surfing" (YouTube)is a great companion. Watch out for those lame videos by the way, be selective. I didn't understand at first where to place the media queries but some research made me aware that you can put it at the bottom of the stylesheet or on a separate stylesheet. I went with the former. Prior to the challenge I was on the ropes with CSS positiong but these fears were quelled as this exercise helped me understand it more and I feel more comfortable with it now.<br>
I was particularly excited about this challenge because of the real world application for these skills and the excitement of making usability inprovements on the fly. For me the hardest part was trying to get the image to adjust with the screen size fluidly. It took me a while but the solution was worth it. </p>
