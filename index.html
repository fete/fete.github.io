    <p>Now being a code newbie comes with many new things you have to learn; and being at a bootcamp where the info is coming fast and heavy you have to make sure you are efficient. One of the tools of being efficient is asking/writing the right questions. After all you need the right answers to progress and keep the ball rolling.
    For the situation where one is writing the question you have to start off with a good title. This entails using error messages, key APIs or unusual circumstances that make your question different and stand out. Make sure your spelling and grammar are spot on also. The last thing you want is for someone to ignore your question because of lack of comprehension or confusion. You may even get an answer that’s not relative, so have another set of eyes look over your question if necessary. Also if you can’t seem to come up with a title just leave it for after you write out your details of what’s  bugging you then summarize it.<br>
    Next thing is the body of the question. Don’t just chug some code down people’s throat and expect them to decipher what’s the problem. Be engaging and explain what led you to encounter the problem and other difficulties. Be sure that the code you do give is specifically relative and allow others to even replicate the problem so they can get a gist of what’s going wrong.
    When using forums or groups to ask questions try to include a tag for the language, library, and specific API your question relates to. If you start typing in the tags field, the system will suggest tags that match what you've typed - be sure and read the descriptions given for them to make sure they're relevant to the question you're asking! Unnecessary tags just clutter things for people later on who may have your same problem or another problem so be considerate. <br>
    Once again proof read! Make sure the question makes sense and your grammar is spot on and as we mentioned before having another pair of eyes viewing it is recommended. <br>
    Once you post your question give feedback, whether it’s clarification you need or thanks you need to dish out. Be active and show your appreciation for the community and or individual that gives you feedback.All in all these tips are useful in both written and verbal questioning. Just take the tips in mind that are relative to your situation. Be short yet informative, and be kind and appreciative.</p>

    <h3>What is Rails?</h3>

    <p>Yes I am learning Ruby and I love it and all it’s lovely methods that make life easier but what’s this Rails thing I always see and hear about. I know it’s something I should probably know but maybe I don’t know enough to need to know what it is…
    Those have been some of my thoughts but tonight I was determined to at least have a basic grasp of what Rails or Ruby On Rails is. So after surfing the net and reading several articles the one by Mr. Daniel Kehoe really stood out as a simplified account  of what Rails is and it allowed me to formulate the following.<br>
    As we know thanks to Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto we’ve been blessed with the Ruby programming language. So how does Rails or Ruby on Rails fit in this picture. For starters,  it was originally coined  “Ruby on Rails” by it’s credited creator David Heinemeier Hansson, but now it tends to go by Rails depending on the weather or personal preference I guess. Rails is a software library that is added to the Ruby programming language and extends it. Technically, it is a package library (specifically, a RubyGem), that is installed using the operating system command-line interface.
    Rails serves as a framework for building websites. As such, Rails establishes conventions for easier collaboration and maintenance. These conventions are codified as the Rails API (the application programming interface, or directives that control the code). Learning Rails means learning how to use the Rails conventions and its API.<br>
    Rails combines the Ruby programming language with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application that runs on a web server. Because it runs on a web server, Rails is considered a server-side, or “back end,” web application development platform (the web browser is the “front end”). Rails, in a larger sense, is more than a software library and an API. It is the central project of a vast community that produces software libraries that simplify the task of building complex websites. Members of the Rails community share many core values, often use the same tools, and support each other with an informal network that is built on volunteerism. Rails is popular among web startups, significantly because the pool of open source software libraries (RubyGems, or “gems”) makes it possible to build complex sites quickly.<br>
    Ok so we have an idea of what Rails is, but what does it do? Web browsers combines three kinds of files—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—to display web pages. A browser obtains the files from a web server. Web servers deliver HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, either from static files that are stored on the server, or from an “application server” that creates files dynamically using a programming language such as Ruby. A software program written in Ruby and organized using Rails conventions is a “web application.” Rails combines the Ruby programming language with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application. Rails uses Ruby to dynamically assemble HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from component files (often adding content from a database).<br>
    Why create a web application? A web browser needs only a single HTML file to display a web page (CSS and JavaScript files are optional). However, if you are creating several web pages, you might want to assemble the HTML file from smaller components. For example, you might make a small file that will be included on every page to make a footer (Rails calls these “partials”). Consider another example: If you are displaying content from a database, you might not want the complex programming code that accesses the database mixed into your HTML (programmers call this separation of concerns and it makes for more modular, maintainable programs). Finally, if you are using a web application server such as the one supplied with Rails, you can add features to your website that have been developed and tested by other people so you don’t have to build everything yourself. These are all reasons to create a web application.<br>
    Thus Ruby on Rails make the development of web applications easier. So we now have a better idea of what the fuss seems to be about…efficiency and convenience. This is just a basic overview and Rails has much more to it but I hope this post has shed some light where there was curiosity.</p>

    <h3>Blogging to Learn & Reflect</h3>

    <p>I wanted to improve my site that is documenting my journey to code so I decided to send the site’s link out to a few reliable friends for some feedback. I must say I was a bit apprehensive at first because I already had some improvements in mind but I thought it’s always better to have some more eyes viewing your work to get different perspectives.<br>
    Upon getting the feedback I was really pleased with the detail of how I can improve the site and of the good things I’ve already done. I sifted through the recommendations and decided to implement some that I can in a timely manner. It should be noted there was some suggestions that I will implement but not at this time due to the time required. I’m trying to maintain some time-boxing for efficiency sake.<br>
    From the suggestions I got I decided to make the following changes:<br>
              - improve the images for the social media nav bar<br>
              - Improved the header<br>
              - adjusted the margins of certain elements<br>
              - cleaned up the code for the CSS<br>
              Now I had a much longer list but once I got started I noticed so many more code improvements can be made. For instance, with my nav bar I realized that I needed it to be floated and also width and margin adjustments needed to be made to accommodate the other respective changes. This was a common theme. As I made one adjustment I had to readjust many other elements to make sure the site looked balanced. As I made the header position fixed I needed to adjust the positioning of the other elements such as the nav bar and social media bar and the div that contains the image and the current info.<br>
    As I made the respective changes though I not only reinforced some concepts I learned but I noticed a difference in the appearance of the site. The process of attaining feedback surely helped and made me even more motivated to fix certain elements because now I can’t wait for my friends to view the site again and share their thoughts once more…and the feedback and pushing code loop will continue.</p>
