    <p>The following blogs express some views I have gathered from my opinions and research. Writing definitely provides an outlet for reinforcing what I have learned and also self expression. My writing much in a way reflects me but I am more than just words ... aren't we all so feel free to reach out if need be.</p>

    <p>Now being a code newbie comes with many new things you have to learn; and being at a bootcamp where the info is coming fast and heavy you have to make sure you are efficient. One of the tools of being efficient is asking/writing the right questions. After all you need the right answers to progress and keep the ball rolling.
    For the situation where one is writing the question you have to start off with a good title. This entails using error messages, key APIs or unusual circumstances that make your question different and stand out. Make sure your spelling and grammar are spot on also. The last thing you want is for someone to ignore your question because of lack of comprehension or confusion. You may even get an answer that’s not relative, so have another set of eyes look over your question if necessary. Also if you can’t seem to come up with a title just leave it for after you write out your details of what’s  bugging you then summarize it.<br>
    Next thing is the body of the question. Don’t just chug some code down people’s throat and expect them to decipher what’s the problem. Be engaging and explain what led you to encounter the problem and other difficulties. Be sure that the code you do give is specifically relative and allow others to even replicate the problem so they can get a gist of what’s going wrong.
    When using forums or groups to ask questions try to include a tag for the language, library, and specific API your question relates to. If you start typing in the tags field, the system will suggest tags that match what you've typed - be sure and read the descriptions given for them to make sure they're relevant to the question you're asking! Unnecessary tags just clutter things for people later on who may have your same problem or another problem so be considerate. <br>
    Once again proof read! Make sure the question makes sense and your grammar is spot on and as we mentioned before having another pair of eyes viewing it is recommended. <br>
    Once you post your question give feedback, whether it’s clarification you need or thanks you need to dish out. Be active and show your appreciation for the community and or individual that gives you feedback.All in all these tips are useful in both written and verbal questioning. Just take the tips in mind that are relative to your situation. Be short yet informative, and be kind and appreciative.</p>
