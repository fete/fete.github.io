    <p>Now being a code newbie comes with many new things you have to learn; and being at a bootcamp where the info is coming fast and heavy you have to make sure you are efficient. One of the tools of being efficient is asking/writing the right questions. After all you need the right answers to progress and keep the ball rolling.
    For the situation where one is writing the question you have to start off with a good title. This entails using error messages, key APIs or unusual circumstances that make your question different and stand out. Make sure your spelling and grammar are spot on also. The last thing you want is for someone to ignore your question because of lack of comprehension or confusion. You may even get an answer that’s not relative, so have another set of eyes look over your question if necessary. Also if you can’t seem to come up with a title just leave it for after you write out your details of what’s  bugging you then summarize it.<br>
    Next thing is the body of the question. Don’t just chug some code down people’s throat and expect them to decipher what’s the problem. Be engaging and explain what led you to encounter the problem and other difficulties. Be sure that the code you do give is specifically relative and allow others to even replicate the problem so they can get a gist of what’s going wrong.
    When using forums or groups to ask questions try to include a tag for the language, library, and specific API your question relates to. If you start typing in the tags field, the system will suggest tags that match what you've typed - be sure and read the descriptions given for them to make sure they're relevant to the question you're asking! Unnecessary tags just clutter things for people later on who may have your same problem or another problem so be considerate. <br>
    Once again proof read! Make sure the question makes sense and your grammar is spot on and as we mentioned before having another pair of eyes viewing it is recommended. <br>
    Once you post your question give feedback, whether it’s clarification you need or thanks you need to dish out. Be active and show your appreciation for the community and or individual that gives you feedback.All in all these tips are useful in both written and verbal questioning. Just take the tips in mind that are relative to your situation. Be short yet informative, and be kind and appreciative.</p>

    <h3>What is Rails?</h3>

    <p>Yes I am learning Ruby and I love it and all it’s lovely methods that make life easier but what’s this Rails thing I always see and hear about. I know it’s something I should probably know but maybe I don’t know enough to need to know what it is…
    Those have been some of my thoughts but tonight I was determined to at least have a basic grasp of what Rails or Ruby On Rails is. So after surfing the net and reading several articles the one by Mr. Daniel Kehoe really stood out as a simplified account  of what Rails is and it allowed me to formulate the following.<br>
    As we know thanks to Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto we’ve been blessed with the Ruby programming language. So how does Rails or Ruby on Rails fit in this picture. For starters,  it was originally coined  “Ruby on Rails” by it’s credited creator David Heinemeier Hansson, but now it tends to go by Rails depending on the weather or personal preference I guess. Rails is a software library that is added to the Ruby programming language and extends it. Technically, it is a package library (specifically, a RubyGem), that is installed using the operating system command-line interface.
    Rails serves as a framework for building websites. As such, Rails establishes conventions for easier collaboration and maintenance. These conventions are codified as the Rails API (the application programming interface, or directives that control the code). Learning Rails means learning how to use the Rails conventions and its API.<br>
    Rails combines the Ruby programming language with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application that runs on a web server. Because it runs on a web server, Rails is considered a server-side, or “back end,” web application development platform (the web browser is the “front end”). Rails, in a larger sense, is more than a software library and an API. It is the central project of a vast community that produces software libraries that simplify the task of building complex websites. Members of the Rails community share many core values, often use the same tools, and support each other with an informal network that is built on volunteerism. Rails is popular among web startups, significantly because the pool of open source software libraries (RubyGems, or “gems”) makes it possible to build complex sites quickly.<br>
    Ok so we have an idea of what Rails is, but what does it do? Web browsers combines three kinds of files—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—to display web pages. A browser obtains the files from a web server. Web servers deliver HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, either from static files that are stored on the server, or from an “application server” that creates files dynamically using a programming language such as Ruby. A software program written in Ruby and organized using Rails conventions is a “web application.” Rails combines the Ruby programming language with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application. Rails uses Ruby to dynamically assemble HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from component files (often adding content from a database).<br>
    Why create a web application? A web browser needs only a single HTML file to display a web page (CSS and JavaScript files are optional). However, if you are creating several web pages, you might want to assemble the HTML file from smaller components. For example, you might make a small file that will be included on every page to make a footer (Rails calls these “partials”). Consider another example: If you are displaying content from a database, you might not want the complex programming code that accesses the database mixed into your HTML (programmers call this separation of concerns and it makes for more modular, maintainable programs). Finally, if you are using a web application server such as the one supplied with Rails, you can add features to your website that have been developed and tested by other people so you don’t have to build everything yourself. These are all reasons to create a web application.<br>
    Thus Ruby on Rails make the development of web applications easier. So we now have a better idea of what the fuss seems to be about…efficiency and convenience. This is just a basic overview and Rails has much more to it but I hope this post has shed some light where there was curiosity.</p>

    <h3>Blogging to Learn & Reflect</h3>
    <p>10/26/14<br>By Clifton Thomas</p>

    </figure>
    <p>I wanted to improve my site that is documenting my journey to code so I decided to send the site’s link out to a few reliable friends for some feedback. I must say I was a bit apprehensive at first because I already had some improvements in mind but I thought it’s always better to have some more eyes viewing your work to get different perspectives.<br>
    Upon getting the feedback I was really pleased with the detail of how I can improve the site and of the good things I’ve already done. I sifted through the recommendations and decided to implement some that I can in a timely manner. It should be noted there was some suggestions that I will implement but not at this time due to the time required. I’m trying to maintain some time-boxing for efficiency sake.<br>
    From the suggestions I got I decided to make the following changes:<br>
              - improve the images for the social media nav bar<br>
              - Improved the header<br>
              - adjusted the margins of certain elements<br>
              - cleaned up the code for the CSS<br>
              Now I had a much longer list but once I got started I noticed so many more code improvements can be made. For instance, with my nav bar I realized that I needed it to be floated and also width and margin adjustments needed to be made to accommodate the other respective changes. This was a common theme. As I made one adjustment I had to readjust many other elements to make sure the site looked balanced. As I made the header position fixed I needed to adjust the positioning of the other elements such as the nav bar and social media bar and the div that contains the image and the current info.<br>
    As I made the respective changes though I not only reinforced some concepts I learned but I noticed a difference in the appearance of the site. The process of attaining feedback surely helped and made me even more motivated to fix certain elements because now I can’t wait for my friends to view the site again and share their thoughts once more…and the feedback and pushing code loop will continue.</p>

    <h3>Dealing With Conflict</h3>
    <p>10/19/14<br>By Clifton Thomas</p>

     <ol>
                 <li>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</li>
                 <p>  I don’t get into many conflicts so I had to reach back in my memory for this one. My friends and I were being cursed at by some individuals because they thought we were speaking about them in a negative way. Although I ignored them at first the person kept pressing the issue and began to send racial and ethnic slurs my way. Thus a friend and I decided to confront them to find out what was the problem. The war of words continued and one of the individuals raised their hand to me and a friend  when we approached ... long story short, the individual decided to file a police report because “he was attacked for no reason”.  </p>
                 <li>What was the source of the conflict?</li>
                 <p>The individual felt offended by something they thought they heard. From my perspective I didn’t appreciate the racial and ethnic slurs and the threats of physical harm.</p>
                 <li>How did you handle that conflict?<li>
                 <p>I approached the person with my hands behind my back and spoke to him in a respectable manner but when my friend and I was threatened with bodily harm we defended ourselves.</p>
                 <li>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?<li>
                 <p>Our actions made things worst. Starting from confronting the individual to acting to defend ourselves.</p>
                 <li>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?<li>
                 <p>I won’t do anything different. That situation has changed me a lot in terms of how I deal with people and I have developed a greater sense of control of my emotions and reading of situations.</p>
                 <li>What did you learn from this experience?<li>
                 <p>I learned that some people love to start stuff and when they come out on the bad end of the deal they do what they can to make your life miserable aka call the police and cry wolf. People are are at times selfish and self gain is a priority. You have to always analyze situations and think of the consequences and make the best decision for you and your future, because when it comes down to it don't let an idiot control your path in life. Be in control always.</p>

    <h3>SQL Injection</h3>
    <p>10/12/14<br>By Clifton Thomas</p> 
  </header>
    <figure>
    <figcaption></figcaption> 
    </figure>
    <p>After learning the basics of SQL I was most fascinated by SQL Injections and decided to expand on it based on the research I did to understand it better. I must credit (mostly) veracode.com and w3school.com for the insight and literature they provided towards my comprehension in this topic.<br>
              SQL Injection is a type of web application security vulnerability in which an attacker is able to submit a database SQL command which is executed by a web application, exposing the back-end database. A web application  that utilizes user-supplied data without proper validation or encoding as part of a command or query are typically vulnerable to attack. The malicious user inputs specially crafted user data that tricks the application into executing unintended commands or changing data. SQL Injection allows an attacker to create, read, update, alter, or delete data stored in the back-end database.  Most commonly SQL Injection attacks gives access to sensitive information such as social security numbers, credit card number or other financial data.<br>
              SQL Injection Preventions:<br>
                  -  Adopt an input validation technique that authenticates against a set of defined rules for length, type, and syntax and also against business rules.<br>
                  - Ensure that users with the permission to access the database have the least privileges, i.e. do not use system administrator accounts like “sa” for Web applications. Also, you should always make sure that a database user is created only for a specific application and this user is not able to access other applications.<br>
                  - Use strongly typed parameterized query APIs with placeholder substitution markers, even when calling stored procedures.<br>
                  - Show care when using stored procedures since they are generally safe from injection. However, be careful as they can be injectable (such as via the use of exec() or concatenating arguments within the stored procedure).</p>

    <h3>Affirmations & Values</h3>
    <p>10/12/14<br>By Clifton Thomas</p> 
  </header>
    <figure>
    <figcaption></figcaption> 
    </figure>
    <p>When you think of the times in your life where you’ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which values come to mind?</p>
              <ul>
                 <li>Accomplishment</li>
                 <li>Activism</li>
                 <li>Affection</li>
                 <li>Close relationships</li>
                 <li>Control</li>
                 <li>Growth</li>
                 <li>Honesty</li>
                 <li>Integrity</li>
                 <li>Loyalty</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Honesty about who I am, what I know and what I stand for are important traits that I hold dear to my  heart. This has molded me to become more at ease with how I live and my views of life.<br>
              Control is an aspect of myself I have worked on and am proud to say it’s a great asset I have. To be able to control my emotions and thought processes has led to many moments of enlightenment and understanding that I value and appreciate as part of my growth.<br> In general, I try to live up to these values: <br>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</p>

              <ul>
                 <li>Accomplishment 5</li>
                 <li>Activism  5</li>
                 <li>Affection  5</li>
                 <li>Close relationships  5</li>
                 <li>Control  5</li>
                 <li>Growth  5</li>
                 <li>Honesty  5</li>
                 <li>Integrity  5</li>
                 <li>Loyalty  5</li>
              </ul>

              <p>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Does it relate to your values?<br>I recently advised a friend about depression. He has been going through a lot and didn’t know how to approach things. After we spoke for a while we got to realize he needed to be more honest with himself. Be honest about his emotions, his lifestyle and relationships. He wasn’t being realistic about his situation and the things he needed to do to make improvements in his life. Though it’s easier said than done, he confirmed that he needs to make the adjustment and will work towards it.<br> Values can be a powerful way to negate stereotype threat if you can bring them to mind when you are under a threat. For this part, consider:<br>

              How do you feel when you think about your values?<br>
              I feel proud and responsible for the fact that not only I have accomplished a lot but I have a responsibility to maintain my standard and beyond to set a good example for others to learn from and even follow.<br>

              Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?<br>
              Yes once I recognize stereotype threat I exercise control and integrity in my actions to show that such judgements don’t phase or dictate how I move on in life. Reacting positive in light of negativity is something I try to always do because this takes great strength and brings a sense of accomplishment and confidence in yourself.<br>

              Can you think of any mental or physical exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?<br>
              I love to go to the gym to get my mind settled and regain focus. For me it’s a time to become one with myself and my goals and block out all negative energy that can engulf my mind. I leave the gym reenergized and ready for the next step forward. </p>
