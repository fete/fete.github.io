      <h1>A Whole Page...For Me!!</h1>

      <div><h3>A Bit On Me</h3>
      <p>I am a life lover and carry the tools of  joy and happiness throughout this great journey. Speaking of journeys, I love to travel, I’m a foodie and meeting people is a great joy! Just one love every time (cue Bob Marley).</br>
My last role was a Product Manager and I would love to pursue a role that allows me to utilize and build on those skills and the challenges that arise.
</p></div>
      <div> <a id="link"href="##"><h3>Hungry for More >>></h3></a>
      <p id="more-info">I have had the great opportunity to be one of the founding members of a startup (SpoiledOnline.com) and helped take it from the ground and off. I have learned a lot along the way and wore many hats. #StartupLife</br> I started in customer service & social media management (being the voice of the company) and rose to Product Management where I led many product launches. My favorite was leading the redesign of the site to improve UI/UX and various funnels.</br>
I eventually decided to delve into code to expand my knowledge and interests, as I’m a sucker for constant learning (allowed me to build my wedding website). This knowledge helped me start my own team and build a Distribution Management System at my last job.</br> After a year and delivering a successful product as the PM, I decided to take some time off and travel the world. I have always wanted to work on something that impacts the world and I believe getting to know the world is one step in that direction. Now I’m back and in the west coast looking to contribute and learn with a great company and team. Side note, these hills are really showing on my calf muscles development! Let the good times roll.
