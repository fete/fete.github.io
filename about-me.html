      <div><h3>A Bit On Me</h3>
      <p>I love life and spread joy where I can. Budding travel junkie, definite foodie and I love meeting people. One love to all (cue Bob Marley) lol.</br>
      I'm an agile Product Manager who's always trying to improve and continue adding value to the world through technology.
      </p></div>

      <div> <a id="link"href="##"><h3>Hungry for More >>></h3></a>
      <p id="more-info">I have had the great opportunity to be one of the founding members of a startup (SpoiledOnline.com). I have learned a lot along the way and wore many hats. #StartupLife</br> I started in customer service & social media management (being the voice of the company). My love for being the user advocate and affect change allowed me to rise to Product Management where I led many product launches. My favorite was leading the redesign of the site to improve UI/UX and optimized various funnels.</br>
      After some years learning the PM ropes I left to pursue my interests and expand my knowledge. I decided to attend a coding bootcamp to get closer to the metal of product development. My learnings got allowed me to build some side projects and I eventually joined KBC Services to implement a Distribution Management System.</br> After a year a of developing a successful team and MVP, I decided to take some time off and travel the world. I have always wanted to work on something that impacts a wider audience (or the world) and I believe getting to know the world is one step in that direction. These days I've been working on my mobile dev skills so that I can develop some hobby projects. Let the good times roll.
